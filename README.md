## 📖 Task 1: Python Logic & Mini Projects

This notebook focuses on applying Python fundamentals through practical, interactive examples:

### 🔹 **Smart Elevator Simulation**
* **The Problem:** Managing floor requests efficiently.
* **The Solution:** Simulates an intelligent system that selects the **nearest request** based on the current floor.
* **Skills:** Decision-making, real-world logic, and state management.

### 🔹 **Rule-Based Chatbot**
* **The Problem:** Automated user interaction.
* **The Solution:** A keyword-based chatbot using **predefined rules** and responses.
* **Skills:** Dictionaries, Input validation, and String manipulation.
